## searches in old & new polyphonic music. The adventure of each, singing his individual part of the Unity.

Inspirator, conductor, and/or singer **Marnix De Cat** founded the ensemble to perform music based on Truth of the human being, with a message of beauty and joy. In times of mondial disturbance the idea is to have a good influence both on musicians and public, by programming, playing and explaining music in its context. Let's eliminate the disturbance by exploring and working on the cause, this means our own self... The name comes from the 'dwarf'-planet 'Pluto', the third mistery-planet of the Aquarius-era. After Uranus and Neptunus, influencing the heart and the mind, Pluto is the re-creator of man as a higher being.

_The Cloud Upon the Sanctuary - K. Eckartshausen (Letter 3)_

_"Our desire, our aim, our office is to revivify the dead letter, and to spiritualise the symbols, turn the passive into the active, death into life; but this we cannot do by ourselves, but through the spirit of light of Him who is Wisdom and the Light of the world."_

## Roots:

## Polyphonic Music, then and now...

The Pluto-ensemble, with its inspirator Marnix De Cat grounded in the early tradition of the **Franco-Flemish Polyphony**, also wants to open other musical fields. From the 14th century Ars Nova and Ars Subtilior, over the Golden Renaissance from Flanders to Italy, France, Germany and England, Polyphony keeps up its remarkable and exciting way to tease the ears. Over classical polyphonic structures we also pass the Barock-period and meet Fux, Biber, Tuma, Bach... Ending in contemporary polyphonic music in minimal and repetitive music. All the way the sound of polyphony sets each individual musician at a point of surrender to the unity of the sound, keeping his own flow and identity. 

What a joy to join that music making, what a feast to listen too :-)
