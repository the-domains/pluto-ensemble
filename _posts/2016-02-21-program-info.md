## ' Animam gementem cano '

'Animam gementem cano' (I sing of the sighing soul) takes us on a journey through many of life's most important events. We come face to face with life and death (Requiem), and with Maria weeping at the cross (Stabat Mater), guiding us along the life-long path to self-consciousness. 'Maria' allows our soul to connect with peace and harmony, far away from the turbulent world of every day existence. The crying soul once again discovers its original state. Hope returns out of the psalm 109\.

The most important composers of the 17th and 18th century passed through Vienna. J.H. Schmelzer (at the Viennese court) and H.I.F. Biber (in Salzburg) were responsible for the remarkable rise of the violin and its rapidly developing technique. The gamba consort still holds a special place in their music.

With the composer F. Tuma, himself a gambist, we see the last use of the gamba or simply for continuo or as solo-instrument, here accompanying a vokal solist (as we find in music of his well-known contemporary Bach).

The imperial court of Leopold I played an important role in European musical life of the time. Like Tuma, many composers were attracted to J.J. Fux as an important teacher and contrapuntalist.

He wrote in all five "Stabat Mater", and the version we hear today shall be a new premiere. The manuscript lay long forgotten in the Ottobeuren Library waiting to be transcribed!

Probably written (1752?) towards the end of his life, one can hear simple rococo-like melodies, as well as rich harmonies.

While G.P. Colonna was not a court composer in Vienna, Keizer Leopold arranged that a copy of each of his new religious works be sent to Vienna. (This was so). Colonna was called the Orpheus of Italy, and worked mostly in Bologna. His music was to be known all over Europe as many manuscripts are found in Brussels, Cambridge, London, and...  Vienna!

## Voyces & Viols

" Voyces & Viols " takes us into the world of the vocal and instrumental consort music of Thomas Tomkins (1572-1656). As a student of William Byrd, Tomkins continued the latter's own rich contribution to the English polyphonic tradition. He was friend and fellow organist of Orlando Gibbons at the Royal Chapel where he continued making music up until his death. Tomkins could be considered the most important renewer of English music between Byrd and Henry Purcell.

" Voyces & Viols " traces the voyage of a once melancholic soul which, after listening to the heart and following enlightened reflection, can only praise its Creator. From delicate three-part polyphony to an explosion of melody, harmony, and colour.

Make this journey with a perhaps lesser known but not less genious composer from the first half of the seventeenth century.
